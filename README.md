# WeatherAPP

Build a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities.

Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.

Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

Your app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Display the following under current weather conditions:

City

Date

Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

Temperature

Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:
